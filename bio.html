				<p><b>Ryan Wheless</b> is a saxophonist and clarinetist who has been shaped by a world of influences, 
					both within and beyond music. Originally from Seattle, the young kid moved to the Arizona desert, 
					not far from the Grand Canyon, where he spent his formative years in the mountain town of Flagstaff. 
					Amidst mountain hikes and wild camping, the seeds of his musical obsession began to take root.
				</p>
				<p>Despite being too young to play at most venues, Wheless managed to sneak into gigs with jam bands and indie folk ensembles. 
					His talent caught the eye of Berklee College of Music, where he was invited to further his studies in Boston. 
					Often travelling to New York City during this time, the beating heart of the Jazz music's capital would take hold of 
					his tastes and under the guidance of mentors Lauren Sevian and Harry Skoler, his obsession for jazz music and improvisation grew. 
					However, drawn by the call of family, friends, and the expanse of the desert, Ryan found himself in Tucson, where his passion for 
					jazz found a new home, fueled by a tonne of inspiration from the luminaries of the NYC jazz scene.
				</p>
				<p>This led to the formation of <b>space travelers union</b> - a collective dedicated to pushing the boundaries of acoustic and 
					electronic fusion with the members comprising all the best musicians that Ryan had met in his travels.</p>
				<p>Their debut album, <b>'the trials of bunny john'</b> was conceived and recorded in just one week at <b>EastWest Studios in LA</b>. 
					A challenge embraced by the band, many tracks were improvised live in the studio, 
					resulting in this ridiculously brilliant ten-track collection by end of play. </p>
				<p>Influenced by the likes of <b>Miles Davis, Herbie Hancock, Robert Glasper, Yussef Dayes, and Toro y Moi</b>, 
					the new album arrives like a breath of fresh air, a welcome reprieve from the factory-mill of releases out there. 
					The individual tracks are a delightful addition to any playlist fitting any time of the day whilst the album's flow rewards 
					full and repeated listens. </p>
				<p>Slated for release via Asta Hiroki's Most Least imprint in 2024 it's a record destined to please jazz heads and 
					modern music aficionados alike, equally affecting under city lights or in the middle of the desert, it's music to get lost in... </p>
